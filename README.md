Web Reel Automated Publishing.

While initially developed for the film production industry, W.R.A.P. can be
seen as a very simplified CMS.

The main goal is to be able to create sections and pages by adding folders and
files in the website directory. This way, the web site can be updated with any
file transfer software (by FTP, webdav, ssh).

It is not intended to be a full-featured CMS. Instead, it allows to
automatically publish videos and pictures playlists.
