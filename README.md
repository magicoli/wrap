It's a W.R.A.P.

Wrap is a basic csm, aimed to display mostly galleries of images or videos.
The idea is to allow the website maintainer to push media in subfolders. 
The structure of the websites and the menus is detected automatically.

It is not documented, and it works only with PHP5 for now. Work is in progress
to adapt it for PHP7 (mostly because of a huge amount of ereg, ereg_match and
ereg_replace calls!).
