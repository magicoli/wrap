# Web Reel Automated Publishing: it's a W.R.A.P.

Wrap is a basic CMS, aimed to display mostly galleries of images or videos.
The idea is to allow the website maintainer to push media in subfolders. 
The structure of the websites and the menus is detected automatically.

It is designed for fast, efficient media transmission. Although it is
possible to make a pretty beautiful website with this system (and I did), it's
not the goal.

It is not documented, and it works only with PHP5 for now. Work is in progress
to adapt it for PHP7 (mostly because of a huge amount of ereg, ereg_match and
ereg_replace calls!).
