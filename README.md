Wrap is a basic CMS, aimed to display mostly galleries of images or videos.
The idea is to allow the website maintainer to push media in subfolders.
The structure of the websites and the menus is detected automatically.

It is not intended to be a full-featured CMS. Instead, it allows to
automatically publish videos and pictures playlists.

It is designed for fast, efficient media transmission. Although it is
possible to make a pretty beautiful website with this system (and I did), it's
not the goal.

It is poorly documented, but it works now with PHP7 (and probably 8).
