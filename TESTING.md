# Testing Legacy Path Updates

## Quick Test Commands

```bash
# 1. Test that the main entry point loads without errors
php -l wrap.php

# 2. Test that legacy files can be found
php -c -r "include 'legacy/legacy-wrap.php'; echo 'Legacy loaded successfully';"

# 3. Check that CSS files exist in new locations
ls -la legacy/css/
ls -la legacy/themes/
ls -la legacy/js/

# 4. Test a web request (if you have a web server running)
curl -I http://localhost/wrap-5.5/
```

## Key Files Updated:

1. **CSS/JS Paths**: Updated to point to `/legacy/css/` and `/legacy/js/`
2. **Module Includes**: Updated to point to `/legacy/modules/`
3. **Template Paths**: Updated to point to `/legacy/themes/`
4. **Facebook SDK Path**: Fixed missing slash in path

## Files That Should Work Without Changes:

- `inc/init.php` and `inc/functions.php` - use relative paths within legacy/
- Internal includes within modules - they use relative paths
- Most file operations - they use `__DIR__` or DOCUMENT_ROOT

## Next Steps:

1. Test the application in a browser
2. Check for any missing CSS/styling
3. Verify that all includes work properly
4. Test basic functionality (directory browsing, file display)

If everything works, we can commit this as the completion of the first major task!
